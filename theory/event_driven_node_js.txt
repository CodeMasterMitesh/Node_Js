1. What Does "Event-Driven" Mean?
Event-driven means the flow of the program is determined by events.

Instead of running instructions one by one in a fixed sequence, the program listens for events (like a user clicking a button, a file finishing loading, or a network request completing) and then executes a callback function when that event occurs.

In Node.js, almost everything works around this idea.

2. Why Event-Driven in Node.js?
Node.js was designed for:

Scalability: handling thousands of requests at the same time.

Non-blocking I/O: it doesn’t wait for a slow operation (like reading a file or database query).
Instead, it registers a callback and continues doing other work.
When the operation finishes, Node emits an event to trigger the callback.

This is possible because of the event loop.

3. The Event Loop
At the core of Node.js is the event loop, which:

Listens for events (like incoming HTTP requests, file completion, timers, etc.).

Queues them.

Executes the callback functions tied to those events.

So Node.js doesn’t “pause” while waiting; it just registers events and responds when they happen.

4. EventEmitter in Node.js
Node.js has a built-in module called events.
It provides the EventEmitter class, which is the backbone of Node’s event-driven architecture.
